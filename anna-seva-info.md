# अन्न सेवा (Anna Seva) - Feed Needy, Reduce Waste

An elegantly designed, full-stack food rescue and redistribution web application. Operated under the patronage of the **Shri Vishwanathrao Shamrao Patil Charitable Trust**, Anna Seva connects verified donors (banquets, caterers, restaurants, and households) with local recipient organizations (NGOs, shelter homes, and volunteers) to direct surplus food batches to those who need them most.
